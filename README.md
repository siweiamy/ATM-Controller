Executable is in ATM.java

I initialized two entries for customerInfo, please use the following card number and pin to start.

cardID: 111111, PIN: 123456

cardID: 111112, PIN: 123456

You can also add new coustomers and update the HaspMap coustomerInfo.

Just run ATM.java and follow the prompts in terminal.
